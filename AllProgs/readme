SOURCE CODE FOR FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA STRUCTURES IN C++
======================================================

1) Feel free to use the code in any way you wish, but please 
   acknowledge the source.

2) Note that some of the files contained here might represent 
   older versions of the code. In some cases, files do not 
   contain complete C++ programs, but rather C++ pseudocode.
   These files will not compile. The remaining files were 
   compiled using Borland C++, version 3.1. Please be aware
   that the same files sometimes did not compile under other
   C++ compilers! The reader is referred to <mention C++ journal
   article for a discussion on the inconsistencies among current
   C++ compilers>

3) Please report any bugs in the code (or if the code does not 
   match the text) by email to dmehta@utsi.edu.
